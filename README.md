# Getting Started with Streamify

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Streamify

Streamify is a decentralized application (dApp) built with React and Node.js that provides a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and managing Superfluid streams. With Streamify, users can automate payment flows and enjoy the benefits of Superfluid's continuous, real-time token streams.

## Features

- **Create, Update, and Delete Superfluid Streams:** Schedule and manage automated token streams with customizable parameters such as receiver's address, flow rate, token selection, start date, end date, and update date.

- **Customizable Flow Rates:** Set flow rates for your streams, allowing precise control over the rate of token transfers.

- **Multiple Token Support:** Select the desired token for your streams, providing flexibility and compatibility with various ERC-20 tokens.

- **Start and End Dates:** Specify start and end dates for your streams, enabling precise scheduling of automated payments.

- **Update Stream Option:** Streamify also offers the ability to update streams and update flowrate whenever needed. Users can modify parameters such as the flow rate, update date and even the receiver's address. This flexibility allows users to adapt their payment schedules or make adjustments as their needs change.
